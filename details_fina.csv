Recent Advances in Internet of Things (IoT) Infrastructures for Building Energy Systems: A Review ,Wahiba Yaïci   Karthik Krishnamurthy   Evgueniy Entchev   Michela Longo,/pmc/articles/PMC8003568/,This paper summarises a literature review on the applications of Internet of Things (IoT) with the aim of enhancing building energy use and reducing greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs). A detailed assessment of contemporary practical reviews and works was conducted to understand how different IoT systems and technologies are being developed to increase energy efficiencies in both residential and commercial buildings. Most of the reviewed works were invariably related to the dilemma of efficient heating systems in buildings. Several features of the central components of IoT   namely   the hardware and software needed for building controls   are analysed. Common design factors across the many IoT systems comprise the selection of sensors and actuators and their powering techniques   control strategies for collecting information and activating appliances   monitoring of actual data to forecast prospect energy consumption and communication methods amongst IoT components. Some building energy applications using IoT are provided. It was found that each application presented has the potential for significant energy reduction and user comfort improvement. This is confirmed in two case studies summarised   which report the energy savings resulting from implementing IoT systems. Results revealed that a few elements are user-specific that need to be considered in the decision processes. Last   based on the studies reviewed   a few aspects of prospective research were recommended.
Machine Learning for Authentication and Authorization in IoT: Taxonomy   Challenges and Future Research Direction,Kazi Istiaque Ahmed   Mohammad Tahir   Mohamed Hadi Habaebi   Sian Lun Lau   Abdul Ahad,/pmc/articles/PMC8347961/,With the ongoing efforts for widespread Internet of Things (IoT) adoption   one of the key factors hindering the wide acceptance of IoT is security. Securing IoT networks such as the electric power grid or water supply systems has emerged as a major national and global priority. To address the security issue of IoT   several studies are being carried out that involve the use of   but are not limited to   blockchain   artificial intelligence   and edge/fog computing. Authentication and authorization are crucial aspects of the CIA triad to protect the network from malicious parties. However   existing authorization and authentication schemes are not sufficient for handling security   due to the scale of the IoT networks and the resource-constrained nature of devices. In order to overcome challenges due to various constraints of IoT networks   there is a significant interest in using machine learning techniques to assist in the authentication and authorization process for IoT. In this paper   recent advances in authentication and authorization techniques for IoT networks are reviewed. Based on the review   we present a taxonomy of authentication and authorization schemes in IoT focusing on machine learning-based schemes. Using the presented taxonomy   a thorough analysis is provided of the authentication and authorization (AA) security threats and challenges for IoT. Furthermore   various criteria to achieve a high degree of AA resiliency in IoT implementations to enhance IoT security are evaluated. Lastly   a detailed discussion on open issues   challenges   and future research directions is presented for enabling secure communication among IoT nodes.
