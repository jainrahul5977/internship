A detailed assessment of contemporary practical reviews and works was conducted to understand how different IoT systems and technologies are being developed to increase energy efficiencies in both residential and commercial buildings. Most of the reviewed works were invariably related to the dilemma of efficient heating systems in buildings. Several features of the central components of IoT   namely   the hardware and software needed for building controls   are analysed. Common design factors across the many IoT systems comprise the selection of sensors and actuators and their powering techniques   control strategies for collecting information and activating appliances   monitoring of actual data to forecast prospect energy consumption and communication methods amongst IoT components. Some building energy applications using IoT are provided. It was found that each application presented has the potential for significant energy reduction and user comfort improvement. This is confirmed in two case studies summarised   which report the energy savings resulting from implementing IoT systems. Results revealed that a few elements are user-specific that need to be considered in the decision processes. Last   based on the studies reviewed   a few aspects of prospective research were recommended.
Machine Learning for Authentication and Authorization in IoT: Taxonomy   Challenges and Future Research Direction,Kazi Istiaque Ahmed   Mohammad Tahir   Mohamed Hadi Habaebi   Sian Lun Lau   Abdul Ahad,/pmc/articles/PMC8347961/,With the ongoing efforts for widespread Internet of Things (IoT) adoption   one of the key factors hindering the wide acceptance of IoT is security. Securing IoT networks such as the electric power grid or water supply systems has emerged as a major national and global priority. To address the security issue of IoT   several studies are being carried out that involve the use of   but are not limited to   blockchain   artificial intelligence   and edge/fog computing. Authentication and authorization are crucial aspects of the CIA triad to protect the network from malicious parties. However   existing authorization and authentication schemes are not sufficient for handling security   due to the scale of the IoT networks and the resource-constrained nature of devices. In order to overcome challenges due to various constraints of IoT networks   there is a significant interest in using machine learning techniques to assist in the authentication and authorization process for IoT. In this paper   recent advances in authentication and authorization techniques for IoT networks are reviewed. Based on the review   we present a taxonomy of authentication and authorization schemes in IoT focusing on machine learning-based schemes. Using the presented taxonomy   a thorough analysis is provided of the authentication and authorization (AA) security threats and challenges for IoT. Furthermore   various criteria to achieve a high degree of AA resiliency in IoT implementations to enhance IoT security are evaluated. Lastly   a detailed discussion on open issues   challenges   and future research directions is presented for enabling secure communication among IoT nodes.

Implementation of Sensing and Actuation Capabilities for IoT Devices Using oneM2M Platforms,Jaeseok Yun   Il-Yeup Ahn   JaeSeung Song   Jaeho Kim,/pmc/articles/PMC6832411/,In this paper   we present an implementation work of sensing and actuation capabilities for IoT devices using the oneM2M standard-based platforms. We mainly focus on the heterogeneity of the hardware interfaces employed in IoT devices. For IoT devices (i.e.   Internet-connected embedded systems) to perform sensing and actuation capabilities in a standardized manner   a well-designed middleware solution will be a crucial part of IoT platform. Accordingly   we propose an oneM2M standard-based IoT platform (called nCube) incorporated with a set of tiny middleware programs (called TAS) responsible for translating sensing values and actuation commands into oneM2M-defined resources accessible in Web-based applications. All the source codes for the oneM2M middleware platform and smartphone application are available for free in the GitHub repositories. The full details on the implementation work and open-source contributions are described.
TTEO (Things Talk to Each Other): Programming Smart Spaces Based on IoT Systems,Jaeseok Yun   Il-Yeup Ahn   Sung-Chan Choi   Jaeho Kim,/pmc/articles/PMC4850981/,The Internet of Things allows things in the world to be connected to each other and enables them to automate daily tasks without human intervention   eventually building smart spaces.

IoT-Based Smart Irrigation Systems: An Overview on the Recent Trends on Sensors and IoT Systems for Irrigation in Precision Agriculture,Laura García   Lorena Parra   Jose M. Jimenez   Jaime Lloret   Pascal Lorenz,/pmc/articles/PMC7070544/,Water management is paramount in countries with water scarcity. This also affects agriculture   as a large amount of water is dedicated to that use. The possible consequences of global warming lead to the consideration of creating water adaptation measures to ensure the availability of water for food production and consumption. Thus   studies aimed at saving water usage in the irrigation process have increased over the years. Typical commercial sensors for agriculture irrigation systems are very expensive   making it impossible for smaller farmers to implement this type of system. However   manufacturers are currently offering low-cost sensors that can be connected to nodes to implement affordable systems for irrigation management and agriculture monitoring. Due to the recent advances in IoT and WSN technologies that can be applied in the development of these systems   we present a survey aimed at summarizing the current state of the art regarding smart irrigation systems. We determine the parameters that are monitored in irrigation systems regarding water quantity and quality   soil characteristics and weather conditions. We provide an overview of the most utilized nodes and wireless technologies. Lastly   we will discuss the challenges and the best practices for the implementation of sensor-based irrigation systems.
Building IoT Services for Aging in Place Using Standard-Based IoT Platforms and Heterogeneous IoT Products,Sheik Mohammad Mostakim Fattah   Nak-Myoung Sung   Il-Yeup Ahn   Minwoo Ryu   Jaeseok Yun,/pmc/articles/PMC5677444/,An aging population and human longevity is a global trend. Many developed countries are struggling with the yearly increasing healthcare cost that dominantly affects their economy. At the same time   people living with old adults suffering from a progressive brain disorder such as Alzheimer’s disease are enduring even more stress and depression than those patients while caring for them. Accordingly   seniors’ ability to live independently and comfortably in their current home for as long as possible has been crucial to reduce the societal cost for caregiving and thus give family members peace of mind   called ‘aging in place’ (AIP). In this paper we present a way of building AIP services using standard-based IoT platforms and heterogeneous IoT products. An AIP service platform is designed and created by combining previous standard-based IoT platforms in a collaborative way. A service composition tool is also created that allows people to create AIP services in an efficient way. To show practical usability of our proposed system   we choose a service scenario for medication compliance and implement a prototype service which could give old adults medication reminder appropriately at the right time (i.e.   when it is time to need to take pills) through light and speaker at home but also wrist band and smartphone even outside the home.
An Approach to Share Self-Taught Knowledge between Home IoT Devices at the Edge ,Ingook Jang   Donghun Lee   Jinchul Choi   Youngsung Son,/pmc/articles/PMC6412385/,The traditional Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm has evolved towards intelligent IoT applications which exploit knowledge produced by IoT devices using artificial intelligence techniques. Knowledge sharing between IoT devices is a challenging issue in this trend. In this paper   we propose a Knowledge of Things (KoT) framework which enables sharing self-taught knowledge between IoT devices which require similar or identical knowledge without help from the cloud. The proposed KoT framework allows an IoT device to effectively produce   cumulate   and share its self-taught knowledge with other devices at the edge in the vicinity. This framework can alleviate behavioral repetition in users and computational redundancy in systems in intelligent IoT applications. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed concept   we examine a smart home case study and build a prototype of the KoT framework-based smart home system. Experimental results show that the proposed KoT framework reduces the response time to use intelligent IoT devices from a user’s perspective and the power consumption for compuation from a system’s perspective.
Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT): From Physical (PHY) and Media Access Control (MAC) Layers Perspectives,Collins Burton Mwakwata   Hassan Malik   Muhammad Mahtab Alam   Yannick Le Moullec   Sven Parand   Shahid Mumtaz,/pmc/articles/PMC6603562/,Narrowband internet of things (NB-IoT) is a recent cellular radio access technology based on Long-Term Evolution (LTE) introduced by Third-Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) for Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWAN). The main aim of NB-IoT is to support massive machine-type communication (mMTC) and enable low-power   low-cost   and low-data-rate communication. NB-IoT is based on LTE design with some changes to meet the mMTC requirements. For example   in the physical (PHY) layer only single-antenna and low-order modulations are supported   and in the Medium Access Control (MAC) layers only one physical resource block is allocated for resource scheduling. The aim of this survey is to provide a comprehensive overview of the design changes brought in the NB-IoT standardization along with the detailed research developments from the perspectives of Physical and MAC layers. The survey also includes an overview of Evolved Packet Core (EPC) changes to support the Service Capability Exposure Function (SCEF) to manage both IP and non-IP data packets through Control Plane (CP) and User Plane (UP)   the possible deployment scenarios of NB-IoT in future Heterogeneous Wireless Networks (HetNet). Finally   existing and emerging research challenges in this direction are presented to motivate future research activities.
Ultrasonic-Based Environmental Perception for Mobile 5G-Oriented XR Applications,Luca Davoli   Ioannis Paraskevopoulos   Cinzia Campanella   Stefano Bauro   Tommaso Vio   Andrea Abrardo   Gianluigi Ferrari,/pmc/articles/PMC7918120/,One of the sectors that is expected to significantly benefit from 5G network deployment is eXtended Reality (XR). Besides the very high bandwidth   reliability   and Quality of Service (QoS) to be delivered to end users   XR also requires accurate environmental perception for safety reasons: this is fundamental when a user   wearing XR equipment   is immersed in a “virtual” world   but moves in a “real” environment. To overcome this limitation (especially when using low-cost XR equipments   such as cardboards worn by the end user)   it is possible to exploit the potentialities offered by Internet of Things (IoT) nodes with sensing/actuating capabilities. In this paper   we rely on ultrasonic sensor-based IoT systems to perceive the surrounding environment and to provide “side information” to XR systems   then performing a preliminary experimental characterization campaign with different ultrasonic IoT system configurations worn by the end user. The combination of the information flows associated with XR and IoT components is enabled by 5G technology. An illustrative experimental scenario   relative to a “Tourism 4.0” IoT-aided VR application deployed by Vodafone in Milan   Italy   is presented.
A conflicts’ classification for IoT-based services: a comparative survey,Hamada Ibrhim   Hesham Hassan   Emad Nabil,/pmc/articles/PMC8093958/,Recently   Internet of Things (IoT)-based systems   especially automation systems   have become an indispensable part of modern-day lives to support the controlling of the networked devices and providing context-aware and intelligent environments. IoT-based services/apps developed by the end-users interact with each other and share concurrent access to devices according to their preferences   which increases safety   security   and correctness issues in IoT systems. Due to the critical impacts resulting from these issues   IoT-based apps require a customized type of compilers or checking tools that capable of analyzing the structures of these apps and detecting different types of errors and conflicts either in intra-IoT app instructions or in inter-IoT apps interactions. A plethora of approaches and frameworks have been proposed to assist the best practices for end-users in developing their IoT-based apps and mitigate these errors and conflicts. This paper focuses on conflict classification and detection approaches in the context of IoT systems by investigating the current research techniques that provided conflicts’ classification or detection in IoT systems (published between 2014 and 2020). A classification of IoT-based apps interaction conflicts is proposed. The proposed conflicts’ classification provides a priori conflicts detection method based on the analysis of IoT app instructions’ relationships with utilizing the state-of-the-art Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) model checking and formal notations. The current detection approaches are compared with each other according to the proposed conflicts’ classification to determine to which extend they cover different conflicts. Based on this comparison   we provide evidence that the existing approaches have a gap in covering different conflicts’ levels and types which yields to minimize the correctness and safety of IoT systems. We point out the need to develop a safety and security compiler or tool for IoT systems. Also   we recommend using a hybrid approach that combines model checking with a variety of languages and semantic technologies in developing future IoT-based apps verification frameworks to cover all levels and types of conflicts to guarantee and increase the safety   security   and correctness of IoT systems.

Suitability of NB-IoT for Indoor Industrial Environment: A Survey and Insights,Muhammad Dangana   Shuja Ansari   Qammer H. Abbasi   Sajjad Hussain   Muhammad Ali Imran,/pmc/articles/PMC8399864/,The Internet of Things (IoT) and its applications in industrial settings are set to bring in the fourth industrial revolution. The industrial environment consisting of high profile manufacturing plants and a variety of equipment is inherently characterized by high reflectiveness   causing significant multi-path components that affect the propagation of wireless communications—a challenge among others that needs to be resolved.

IoT Intrusion Detection Taxonomy   Reference Architecture   and Analyses,Khalid Albulayhi   Abdallah A. Smadi   Frederick T. Sheldon   Robert K. Abercrombie,/pmc/articles/PMC8512890/,This paper surveys the deep learning (DL) approaches for intrusion-detection systems (IDSs) in Internet of Things (IoT) and the associated datasets toward identifying gaps   weaknesses   and a neutral reference architecture. A comparative study of IDSs is provided   with a review of anomaly-based IDSs on DL approaches   which include supervised   unsupervised   and hybrid methods. All techniques in these three categories have essentially been used in IoT environments. To date   only a few have been used in the anomaly-based IDS for IoT. For each of these anomaly-based IDSs   the implementation of the four categories of feature(s) extraction   classification   prediction   and regression were evaluated. We studied important performance metrics and benchmark detection rates   including the requisite efficiency of the various methods. Four machine learning algorithms were evaluated for classification purposes: Logistic Regression (LR)   Support Vector Machine (SVM)   Decision Tree (DT)   and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Therefore   we compared each via the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. The study model exhibits promising outcomes for all classes of attacks. The scope of our analysis examines attacks targeting the IoT ecosystem using empirically based   simulation-generated datasets (namely the Bot-IoT and the IoTID20 datasets).
From WSN towards WoT: Open API Scheme Based on oneM2M Platforms,Jaeho Kim   Sung-Chan Choi   Il-Yeup Ahn   Nak-Myoung Sung   Jaeseok Yun,/pmc/articles/PMC5087433/,Conventional computing systems have been able to be integrated into daily objects and connected to each other due to advances in computing and network technologies   such as wireless sensor networks (WSNs)   forming a global network infrastructure   called the Internet of Things (IoT). To support the interconnection and interoperability between heterogeneous IoT systems   the availability of standardized   open application programming interfaces (APIs) is one of the key features of common software platforms for IoT devices   gateways   and servers. In this paper   we present a standardized way of extending previously-existing WSNs towards IoT systems   building the world of the Web of Things (WoT). Based on the oneM2M software platforms developed in the previous project   we introduce a well-designed open API scheme and device-specific thing adaptation software (TAS) enabling WSN elements   such as a wireless sensor node   to be accessed in a standardized way on a global scale. Three pilot services are implemented (i.e.   a WiFi-enabled smart flowerpot   voice-based control for ZigBee-connected home appliances   and WiFi-connected AR.Drone control) to demonstrate the practical usability of the open API scheme and TAS modules. Full details on the method of integrating WSN elements into three example systems are described at the programming code level   which is expected to help future researchers in integrating their WSN systems in IoT platforms   such as oneM2M. We hope that the flexibly-deployable   easily-reusable common open API scheme and TAS-based integration method working with the oneM2M platforms will help the conventional WSNs in diverse industries evolve into the emerging WoT solutions.
Protocol-Based and Hybrid Access Control for the IoT: Approaches and Research Opportunities,Shantanu Pal   Zahra Jadidi,/pmc/articles/PMC8539538/,Internet of Things (IoT) applications and services are becoming more prevalent in our everyday life. However   such an interconnected network of intelligent physical entities needs appropriate security to sensitive information. That said   the need for proper authentication and authorization is paramount. Access control is in the front line of such mechanisms. Access control determines the use of resources only to the specified and authorized users based on appropriate policy enforcement. IoT demands more sophisticated access control in terms of its usability and efficiency in protecting sensitive information. This conveys the need for access control to serve system-specific requirements and be flexibly combined with other access control approaches. In this paper   we discuss the potential for employing protocol-based and hybrid access control for IoT systems and examine how that can overcome the limitations of traditional access control mechanisms. We also focus on the key benefits and constraints of this integration. Our work further enhances the need to build hierarchical access control for large-scale IoT systems (e.g.   Industrial IoT (IIoT) settings) with protocol-based and hybrid access control approaches. We   moreover   list the associated open issues to make such approaches efficient for access control in large-scale IoT systems.
The Art of Designing Remote IoT Devices—Technologies and Strategies for a Long Battery Life,Gilles Callebaut   Guus Leenders   Jarne Van Mulders   Geoffrey Ottoy   Lieven De Strycker   Liesbet Van der Perre,/pmc/articles/PMC7866251/,Long-range wireless connectivity technologies for sensors and actuators open the door for a variety of new Internet of Things (IoT) applications. These technologies can be deployed to establish new monitoring capabilities and enhance efficiency of services in a rich diversity of domains. Low energy consumption is essential to enable battery-powered IoT nodes with a long autonomy. This paper explains the challenges posed by combining low-power and long-range connectivity. An energy breakdown demonstrates the dominance of transmit and sleep energy. The principles for achieving both low-power and wide-area are outlined   and the landscape of available networking technologies that are suited to connect remote IoT nodes is sketched. The typical anatomy of such a node is presented   and the subsystems are zoomed into. The art of designing remote IoT devices requires an application-oriented approach   where a meticulous design and smart operation are essential to grant a long battery life. In particular we demonstrate the importance of strategies such as “think before you talk” and “race to sleep”. As maintenance of IoT nodes is often cumbersome due to being deployed at hard to reach places   extending the battery life of these devices is critical. Moreover   the environmental impact of batteries further demonstrates the need for a longer battery life in order to reduce the number of batteries used.
A Framework for Malicious Traffic Detection in IoT Healthcare Environment,Faisal Hussain   Syed Ghazanfar Abbas   Ghalib A. Shah   Ivan Miguel Pires   Ubaid U. Fayyaz   Farrukh Shahzad   Nuno M. Garcia   Eftim Zdravevski,/pmc/articles/PMC8123414/,The Internet of things (IoT) has emerged as a topic of intense interest among the research and industrial community as it has had a revolutionary impact on human life. The rapid growth of IoT technology has revolutionized human life by inaugurating the concept of smart devices   smart healthcare   smart industry   smart city   smart grid   among others. IoT devices’ security has become a serious concern nowadays   especially for the healthcare domain   where recent attacks exposed damaging IoT security vulnerabilities. Traditional network security solutions are well established. However   due to the resource constraint property of IoT devices and the distinct behavior of IoT protocols   the existing security mechanisms cannot be deployed directly for securing the IoT devices and network from the cyber-attacks. To enhance the level of security for IoT   researchers need IoT-specific tools   methods   and datasets. To address the mentioned problem   we provide a framework for developing IoT context-aware security solutions to detect malicious traffic in IoT use cases. The proposed framework consists of a newly created   open-source IoT data generator tool named IoT-Flock. The IoT-Flock tool allows researchers to develop an IoT use-case comprised of both normal and malicious IoT devices and generate traffic. Additionally   the proposed framework provides an open-source utility for converting the captured traffic generated by IoT-Flock into an IoT dataset. Using the proposed framework in this research   we first generated an IoT healthcare dataset which comprises both normal and IoT attack traffic. Afterwards   we applied different machine learning techniques to the generated dataset to detect the cyber-attacks and protect the healthcare system from cyber-attacks. The proposed framework will help in developing the context-aware IoT security solutions   especially for a sensitive use case like IoT healthcare environment.
